MLAI Hacknight Project

Our learning hacking project is to train a neural network to tell the difference between
photos of different people in the group.

We are keeping it simple at first 

Basic Steps

1. Take Photos
2. Crop and Resize to 64x64 make gray scale
3. Load
4. Train
5. Tweak

Here is how we are taking taking the photos, we have collected 30 photos of each person.

We take them in this order:

1. Looking Forward, neutral
2. Looking Forward, smile
3. Looking Forward, frown
4. Looking Left, neutral, smile, frown
5. Looking Right, neutral, smile, frown
6. Looking Up, neutral, smile, frown
7. Lookint Down, neutral, smile, frown
8. Go through this list twice

We've collected pretty much all the photos on the first hack night!
